•	Relational Operators
•	Special Operators
•	Set Operators
1.	Arthemetic Operators ( /, +, *, - )
o	It is used to do the mathematical functions Ex : select 2+2,2*2 from dual;
2.	Logical Operators ( And, Or, Not )
o	Ex-1 : select * from emp where deptno=10 and sal>1000;
o	Ex-2 : select * from emp where deptno=10 or deptno=20;
o	Ex-3 : select * from emp where not deptno=20;
3.	Relational Operators ( =, <, >, <=, >=, != )
Ex-1 : select * from emp where deptno <=20;
4.	Special Operators ( Is, In, Like, Between )
o	Ex-1 : select * from emp where comm is null;
o	Ex-2 : select * from emp where comm is not null;
o	Ex-3 : select * from emp where sal in ( 800, 1500, 2000);
o	Ex-4 : select * from emp where sal between 1000 and 2000;
o	Ex-4 : select * from emp where ename like ‘—‘;
o	Ex-5 : select * from emp where ename like ‘s%’;



select * from employees where department_id=10 or salary>1000;
